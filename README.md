# Text Summarization Using NLP

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Text Summarization model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to generate concise and coherent summaries of longer texts.

## Features

- **Extractive Summarization:** Utilizes extractive summarization techniques to identify and extract the most important sentences from the input text.
- **Abstractive Summarization (Work-in-Progress):** The repository aims to incorporate abstractive summarization techniques for more advanced and context-aware summaries.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

Setting up Text Summarization is a breeze! Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/2HR3Y/Text-Summarization-Using-NLP.git
    cd Text-Summarization-Using-NLP
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   This will automatically fetch and install all the necessary packages to ensure a smooth experience.

3. **You're ready to go!**

    Now that the installation is complete, you're all set to dive into the fascinating world of text summarization.

   ```python
   # Example code snippet
   from text_summarizer import TextSummarizer

   text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit..."
   summarizer = TextSummarizer()
   summary = summarizer.summarize(text)

   print("Original Text:")
   print(text)
   print("\nSummary:")
   print(summary)
   ```


## Usage

To use the text summarization model, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the `TextSummarizer` class from the `text_summarizer` module.

    ```python
    from text_summarizer import TextSummarizer
    ```

2. Create an instance of the `TextSummarizer` class.

    ```python
    summarizer = TextSummarizer()
    ```

3. Provide a text to be summarized.

    ```python
    text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. ..."
    ```

4. Generate the summary using the `summarize` method.

    ```python
    summary = summarizer.summarize(text)
    ```

5. Print the original text and the generated summary.

    ```python
    print("Original Text:")
    print(text)
    print("\nSummary:")
    print(summary)
    ```

This example demonstrates a basic usage of the text summarization model. Feel free to experiment with different texts and explore all the use cases.
